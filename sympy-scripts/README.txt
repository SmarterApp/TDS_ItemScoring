As mentioned in "Running Item Scoring Engine.docx" file, 
EqScoringWebService.py is the python scoring script.

However, it needs cherrypy and sympy. Please see the Word document
for more details on version of cherrypy. You will have to install
the required version of cherrypy from the official website.
We will not discuss cherrypy further here.

Sympy however, has been customized by AIR.

For the customized version of sympy there are no installation files/folders.
You will see a zip file called site-packages.zip. 


You will need Python-2.7.  
If you have installed Python into c:\python27 folder then you 
will see a subfolder C:\install\Python27\Lib\site-packages.

Copy the contents of the unzipped site-packages.zip in the the folder mentioned above.
