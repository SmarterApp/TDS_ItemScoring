<p>When asked to join a global peace keeping organization, the United<strong> </strong>States struggled to comply. Why did America not join an organization that is meant for the peace of all countries including their own? There are three main reasons why.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>One reason why is Americans believed in isolation. Why should America go to war and stick their noses up the business of other countries? They believed that the United States should isolate themselves and attend to domestic affairs. Why worry about the problem of other countries if America has problems of their own. In their views, America would gain the most strength by focusing on themselves.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Another reason is that this is the last thing the isolationists wanted. They did not want the United States to create any ties with other countries and felt that they are better off without having other authorities to answer to when it comes down to decisions declaring war. By joining the League of Nations, many Americans thought that they would lead America to future wars that could be avoided. It seemed like America would not gain any benefits by joining the organization.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>The last reason is the League of Nation was unpromising in the American view. They felt that the United States should not have to answer to the council or assembly of the League of Nations. Also they shouldnt be obligated to pay for the expenses of the league. In addition, in the event of an attack by a foreign country, the United States had the right to engage its own defense without needing the orders of the League. The U.S. members felt that the League of Nations did not represent the road to world peace, but instead a path to a submissive state.</p>
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>In the end, The United States voted against the League of Nations. Even though their president help create the organization, they never joined.</p>
