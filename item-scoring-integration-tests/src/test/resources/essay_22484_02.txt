<p>The United States has struggled with the options of entering war which causes conflict between different nations through out the globe. These wars both claimed lives an causes millions of casualties. Due to the intensity of modern warfare, many Americans sought to end the violence and chaos that would continue to threaten their country amongst other opposing countries in the future. Woodrow Wilson introduced a plan for peace or as known as the Fourteen Points. After the war ended, the three major Allied powers decided to obey the Treaty of Versailles and end military action against Germany. This treaty was later named the League of Nations and it was meant to preseve peace. But this later failed and in an effort to restore global peacekeeping, the United Nations was formed to also preseve peace.</p>

<p>Majority of the United States congressmen and citiens did not support the League of Nations. Many believed that the League of Nations would force America&#39;s hand in any future conflicts. Driving the US into more violence and conflicts, rather than keeping the US away from it. Americans believed the United States should isolate itself and attend to doestic afffairs which would help the nation gain the most strength- by concentrating on efforts at home rather than across the nation. To the members, the League of Nations lead to the United States to a path of a submissive state, and not the road to peace within the world. So in a vote of March in 1920, the Senate vote was 49-35, and the Treaty was defeated.</p>

<p>On October 25, 1945, the United Nations offically came into being. Though the UN had many successes, opposing opinions of the peacekeeping organization persisted. Some people questions whether or not the UN has any real global authority. Many feel the UN is powerless when member nations ignore the resolutions or act without any support. Also, others claim the organization is too large, berueaucratic, and susceptible to make significant change. The UN has also faced charges for jeopardizing other nations&#39; sovereignty in favor of protecting others. In conclusion, there are many different opinons based on perspecitives from many critics who argue that the UN should step up its efforts, to continue directing its focus towards humanitarian and relief efforts, or just think the global organization is outdated and ineffective. These are the people who favor their nations&#39; withdraw. These are the struggles the United States faced when trying to join a global peacekeeping organization.</p>
