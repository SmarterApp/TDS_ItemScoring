namespace Ast.OpenCsv {
	/// <summary>
    /// Ast.OpenCsv is an extremely fast and stable C# code ported from the Java version. 
    /// It's stream based parser and can parse virtually any commonly found delimited data format, 
	/// CSV files, tab delimited files, etc. It's usable from C#, VB.Net, ASP.Net, or any other .Net language. It's compatible with the 1.0 
	/// .Net framework, 1.1, 2.0, and even the .Net Compact Framework. The methods are designed for ease of use, while the inner architecture 
	/// is designed purely for speed and efficiency. Parsing is done using the de facto standard CSV file specifications. It handles quoted 
	/// fields, delimiters in the data, and even data that spans across multiple lines. This gives you the ability to open csv files, edit 
	/// csv files, and save csv files all directly from code. Data can be parsed in less than half of the time of any other parser it has 
	/// been benchmarked against. 
	/// Rough benchmarks on a 2 Ghz processor, parsing common comma separated columns is 20 MB, or 390,000 rows with 5 columns each, 
	/// almost 2,000,000 cells total, of data parsing per second. Virtually no garbage collection is needed from the framework because of 
	/// object reuse internally while parsing. All development is thoroughly unit tested to guarantee fewer bugs and to insure proper 
	/// handling of extreme cases, currently showing 99% coverage using 134 test cases and 729 asserts across 2800 lines of test code. 
	/// Pricing is extremely cheap and licensing is amazingly open. One license is good across all machines enterprise wide.
